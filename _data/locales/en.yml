    question: What Does Homebrew Do?
    what: Homebrew installs <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/" title="List of Homebrew packages">the stuff you need</a> that Apple (or your Linux system) didn’t.
    how: Homebrew installs packages to their own directory and then symlinks their files into <code>/usr/local</code>.
    prefix: Homebrew won’t install files outside its prefix and you can place a Homebrew installation wherever you like.
    createpackages: Trivially create your own Homebrew packages.
    hack: It’s all Git and Ruby underneath, so hack away with the knowledge that you can easily revert your modifications and merge upstream updates.
    formula: "Homebrew formulae are simple Ruby scripts:"
    editor: opens in $EDITOR!
    complement: Homebrew complements macOS (or your Linux system). Install your RubyGems with <code>gem</code> and their dependencies with <code>brew</code>.
    caskinstall: '“To install, drag this icon…” no more. <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/">Homebrew&nbsp;Cask</a> installs macOS apps, fonts and plugins and other non-open source software.'
    caskcreate: Making a cask is as simple as creating a formula.
    install:
      install: Install Homebrew
      paste: Paste that in a macOS Terminal or Linux shell prompt.
      what: The script explains what it will do and then pauses before it does it. Read about other <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Installation">installation options</a>.
