subtitle: The missing package manager for OS X

pagecontent:
  what: Homebrew installs <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/tree/master/Library/Formula" title="List of Homebrew packages">the stuff you need</a> that Apple didn’t.
  how: Homebrew installs packages to their own directory and then symlinks their files into <code>/usr/local</code>.
  prefix: Homebrew won’t install files outside its prefix, and you can place a Homebrew installation wherever you like.
  createpackages: Trivially create your own Homebrew packages.
  hack: It's all git and ruby underneath, so hack away with the knowledge that you can easily revert your modifications and merge upstream updates.
  formula: "Homebrew formulae are simple Ruby scripts:"
  complement: Homebrew complements OS X. Install your gems with <code>gem</code>, and their dependencies with <code>brew</code>.
  install:
    install: Install Homebrew
    paste: Paste that at a Terminal prompt.
    what: The script explains what it will do and then pauses before it does it. There are more installation options <a href='https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/Installation'>here</a> (needed on 10.5).
