Today, I'd like to announce Homebrew 4.6.0.
The most significant changes since 4.5.0 are opt-in concurrent downloads with `HOMEBREW_DOWNLOAD_CONCURRENCY`, preliminary macOS 26 (Tahoe) support and a built-in `brew mcp-server`.

Major changes and deprecations since 4.5.0:

- [`HOMEBREW_DOWNLOAD_CONCURRENCY` is a new environment variable that allows opt-in to Homebrew's new download concurrency support](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/20342).
  [We recommend using `HOMEBREW_DOWNLOAD_CONCURRENCY=auto` as a starting point](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/20329).
  This will become the default behaviour in a later version of Homebrew (with an opt-out).
- [Homebrew provides preliminary macOS 26 (Tahoe) support.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/20062)
  It will be officially supported after Apple’s public release.
- [`brew mcp-server` is an MCP server for Homebrew and is available in Homebrew by default.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/20041)
- [Miscellaneous additional code deprecations, disables and removals scheduled for Homebrew 4.6.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/20331)

Other changes since 4.5.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- All repositories in the Homebrew organisation, including e.g. [Homebrew/brew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/20164),
  [Homebrew/homebrew-cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/20172) and
  [Homebrew/homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/20171), now use `main` as their default branch.
- [All casks submitted in Homebrew/homebrew-cask must be signed](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/20286).
  We have not yet completed the process of disabling/removing those that aren't but this will happen at some point in the future.

- [`brew --debug` output is a bit quieter by default.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/20311)
