Today I'd like to announce Homebrew 1.4.0. The most significant change since 1.3.0 is that Homebrew filters environment variables.

Major changes and deprecations since 1.3.0:

- Homebrew filters all user environment variables. This reduces errors in installing formulae from source and in Homebrew commands.
- Homebrew's "bottle hooks" [have been removed](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3510). These were added originally to remove Boxen's monkey-patching of Homebrew's internal, private APIs but are no longer necessary for or used by Boxen.
- The Homebrew/science tap is [migrating notable formulae to Homebrew/core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science/issues/6331) and will [be archived](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science/issues/6365) in January 2018. The Homebrew/apache tap [has been deprecated and archived](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3274). In 2018 we will also deprecate and archive the Homebrew/php tap. Over the last few minor versions of Homebrew we've migrated, deprecated and archived most of the formula taps in the Homebrew organisation to improve the reliability, consistency and discoverability of formulae under the Homebrew organisation.
- macOS version analytics [are available](https://brew.sh/analytics/os-version/) on the brew.sh homepage.

Other changes since 1.3.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [Xcode 9.2  is the latest supported version of Xcode](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3542)
- [macOS High Sierra is the latest supported version of macOS](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3121)
- [Homebrew's vendored Ruby is 2.3.3 (the same version as provided by macOS High Sierra). This is only used on older macOS versions.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3164)
- Using the [`HOMEBREW_FORCE_BREWED_CURL`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3533) variable you can [force Homebrew to use its own `curl`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3482) for all downloads. This may be useful combined with the `proxychains-ng` formula in bypassing any grating, ceramic firewalls.
- Homebrew no longer sets [MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3464) when building formulae
- [Homebrew requires the CLT on all but the latest version of macOS (to avoid copious workarounds in formulae)](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3453)
- Homebrew [correctly](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3316) [orders](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3347) [APFS](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3380) [filesystem](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3430) command output
- [`brew config` outputs most `HOMEBREW_*` variables](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3420)
- [`brew readall` and `brew update-reset` are documented commands in `man brew`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3368)
- [Homebrew ignores applications (e.g. Xcode) found in Time Machine backups](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3273)
- [Formulae are loaded from bottles (when sensible)](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3176)
- [`brew linkage` will list possible unnecessary dependencies](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3103)
- [The first-time installation on Mac OS X 10.5 has been improved](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3158)
- [Require some HTTP mirrors for old OS X versions without a system `curl` that consistently supports HTTPS](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3151)
- [Homebrew now always outputs when tapping Homebrew/core (rather than a silent delay)](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3135)
- [Many more `brew audit` checks have been ported to Rubocop so are available in your text editor](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2982)
- [`brew install`ing local bottles no longer requires a `sha256` in the formula](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3105)
- [`brew search` explains what it's searching for at each stage](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3059)
- [`brew pin` documentation explains when and why pinned formulae may be upgraded](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3043)
- [The macOS sandbox message is no longer printed (as it has been on by default for a while)](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3016)
- [`brew audit` will only check for non-libraries in `lib` for new formulae](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2997)

Finally:

- Thanks to our new sponsor, [CommsWorld](https://www.commsworld.com), for hosting our physical hardware. This was particularly helpful for the macOS 10.13 release.
- [Homebrew still accepts donations through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/homebrew). If you can afford it, please consider donating.

Thanks to all our hard-working maintainers, contributors, sponsors and supporters for getting us this far. Enjoy using Homebrew!
