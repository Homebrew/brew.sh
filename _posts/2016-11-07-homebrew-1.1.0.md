Today I'd like to announce Homebrew 1.1.0. We've had a great response to Homebrew 1.0.0 and been iterating on our work there. That 1.1.0 follows 1.0.9 is a happy coincidence due to breaking changes; in the future we may have a e.g. 1.1.10.

1.1.0 contains some breaking changes:

- [Disable SHA-1 checksum support in formulae](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1451)
- [Disable running Homebrew as the `root` user  (e.g. `sudo brew`)](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1452)
- [Bottles with `_or_later` tags no longer use `_or_later` in their filenames so the existing bottle can be reused](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1446)

Some of the changes since 1.0.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [A branch named `stable` (rather than `master`) is used for following Homebrew/brew tags](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1121)
- [`brew test-bot` has moved to its own tap](https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-test-bot)
- [`brew info` now also lists `Requirements` (e.g. `depends_on :foo`) as well as dependencies](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1004)
- [Rubocop configured so Rubocop-supporting editors get the correct messaging for editing files in Homebrew/brew and `Library/Taps`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1128)
- [External `brew` commands can now use `#:` comments to automatically have rich `--help` output](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1205)
- [The `brew.1` manpage points to official external commands (`brew bundle`, `brew cask`, `brew services`)](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1214)
- [OS X Mavericks (10.9) and above now use BSD tar's libarchive LZMA support rather than needing to install `xz` ](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1279)
- [A `brew tap-new` command is available for creating a new tap with a `README` and preconfigured Travis CI file (`.travis.yml`)](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1277)
- [Bottle/binary package creation and extraction has been sped up](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1253)
- [`brew` output has been improved when `git` is not installed](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1380)
- [A new `brew cask reinstall` command was added](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1248)
- [`brew info` now lists required option builds in dependencies output](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1308)

Enjoy using Homebrew!
