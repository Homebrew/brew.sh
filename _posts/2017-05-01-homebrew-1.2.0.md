Today I'd like to announce Homebrew 1.2.0. The most significant change since 1.1.0 is that most Homebrew taps (package repositories) in the [Homebrew GitHub organisation](https://github.com/Homebrew) have been deprecated and the currently buildable software moved into [Homebrew/homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core). This will improve the quality and availability of all their software.

Additionally, as [Homebrew/homebrew-versions](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-versions) has been moved into [Homebrew/homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core) Homebrew provides better, official support for different versions. You can read more about this in the [dedicated versions document](http://docs.brew.sh/Versions.html). Please note our goal isn't to support all versions of all software but to provide some versions and tooling such that you can easily maintain more in your [own tap (package repository)](http://docs.brew.sh/How-to-Create-and-Maintain-a-Tap.html).

Since 1.1.0 the following deprecations have been made:

- [`env :std` and `env :userpaths` in formulae](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1775)
- [`OS.mac?` and `OS.linux?` in formulae](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1674)
- [`fails_with :llvm` in formulae](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1673)
- [`32-bit` options in formulae](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1698)
- [`go get` usage in formulae](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2562)
- [formulae dependencies that need built with non-default options](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2482)
- [new formulae that require patches](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2479)
- [language module requirements (e.g. `depends_on "pygments.rb" => :ruby`)](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2473)
- Universal [options](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1844) and [builds of formulae](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2477)
- [`brew tap` of deprecated, official taps](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2480)
- [`brew cask update` command](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1690)
- [`brew linkapps` and `brew unlinkapps` commands](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1808)
- Various internal APIs on [`ENV.`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1701) and [elsewhere](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2522)

While all the functionality for these deprecations will be supported for the foreseeable future in [Homebrew/brew](https://github.com/homebrew/brew) for 3rd-party usage, [Homebrew/homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core) will be removing the use of these APIs from formulae to improve the user experience.

Since 1.1.0 some new commands are available:

- [`brew cask outdated` shows outdated Casks](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2309)
- [`brew formula` outputs the location of a formula](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1972)
- [`brew update-reset` simplifies cleaning up broken repositories](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1684)

Some of the other changes since 1.1.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [`brew create` uses GitHub metadata to populate fields when creating from a GitHub archive](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2481)
- [`brew audit` provides `--only` and `--except` flags to allow selectively running `brew audit` methods](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2478)
- [`brew search` uses a single GitHub API call for searching all Homebrew and Caskroom taps](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2540)
- [`brew install` creates symlinks in `opt` for formulae aliases (such as versioned aliases)](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1192)
- [`brew update` will symlink shell completions provided by taps](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1708)
- `brew tests` [runs all cask tests (replacing `brew cask-tests`)](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2260) and [all tests use RSpec rather than MiniTest](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2233)
- [New download strategies were added for handling private GitHub repositories](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1763)
- [We store (and report to anonymous analytics) whether a package was installed as a dependency or on request. This is returned as part of `brew info --json=v1`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1813). This is useful in differentiating between top installed packages based on user demand vs. based on large numbers of dependents. This is also used by `brew bundle dump` and `brew bundle cleanup` to handle dependencies more sensibly.
- [Xcode prerelease warnings have been removed](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1710)
- [`brew reinstall`, `upgrade` and `install` always output used options](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1642)
- [`brew tap-new` uses our latest Travis CI recommended configuration providing zero-configuration CI for all formulae taps](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1608)
- [`brew uninstall` now refuses to uninstall a package if other packages that depend on it are still installed](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1082)
- Rubocop is used for [formulae `desc` audits](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2242) and [checking the order of methods in formulae](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2465) rather than requiring `brew audit` be run. This also allows these checks to be run automatically in any editor with Rubocop integration.
- [Setting `HOMEBREW_ENV_FILTERING` will filter all custom user environment variables from `brew`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1753). Eventually we hope to enable this by default.
- [Sensitive tokens in the environment are hidden from untrusted 3rd-party code in `brew install` and `brew test`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2524)
- [`brew services` provides better error reporting using new macOS APIs](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-services/pull/112)

And finally:

- [A new documentation site is at docs.brew.sh](http://docs.brew.sh)
- [A dump of installation, installation on request and build error events is provided on this site](https://brew.sh/analytics/)
- [Homebrew's mailing list has been deprecated in favour of our Discourse forum](https://discourse.brew.sh)
- [Homebrew accepts donations through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/homebrew). If you can afford it, please consider donating.
- [Homebrew uses HackerOne for security vulnerability disclosure](https://hackerone.com/homebrew/)
- Homebrew's CI servers are now provided by [MacStadium](https://www.macstadium.com/) and [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/7e39c35d5581). Thanks to [Positive Internet](http://www.positive-internet.com) for years of friendship, incredible customer support and super reliable hosting.

Thanks to all our hard-working maintainers, contributors, sponsors and supporters for getting us this far. Enjoy using Homebrew!
