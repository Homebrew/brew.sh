Today, I'd like to announce Homebrew 4.5.0.
The most significant changes since 4.4.0 are major improvements to `brew bundle`/`services`, preliminary Linux support for casks, official Support Tiers, Tier 2 ARM64 Linux support, Ruby 3.4 and several deprecations.

Major changes and deprecations since 4.4.0:

#### `brew bundle` and `brew services`

- [The documentation for Homebrew Bundle, `brew bundle` and `Brewfile`](https://docs.brew.sh/Brew-Bundle-and-Brewfile)
  has been [hugely improved](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19802).
  It also documents the many new `brew bundle` features and changes in this release.
- [`brew bundle`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19487)
  and
  [`brew services`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19385)
  are built-in commands instead of being provided by an external tap.
- [`brew bundle (exec|env|sh)` no longer filter the user's environment](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19575) (like other `brew` commands do)
- [`brew services` supports passing multiple formulae](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19565)
- [`Brewfile`s have a `version_file:` DSL that allows `brew bundle` to write to e.g. a `.ruby-version` file based on the installed version](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19579)
- `brew bundle` no longer includes `${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/bin` in the `$PATH` by default.
  You can do this in your `Brewfile` with `ENV["PATH"] = "#{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/bin:#{ENV["PATH"]}"`.

#### Linux casks

- Some Homebrew casks are supported on Linux.
  Right now these are mostly
  [fonts](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/18874)
  and those with
  [Linux binaries](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19121).
  Some casks will never be available on Linux, such as those for macOS-specific software.
  [The Homebrew Linux fonts cask tap has been deprecated as a result](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19834).
- [`brew bump-cask-pr` allows bumping multi-platform casks on Linux](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19510)

#### Support Tiers

- [Homebrew has three documented Support Tiers plus Unsupported](https://docs.brew.sh/Support-Tiers).
  Tier 1, previously called "supported", is where you'll get bottles/binary packages and we have CI coverage.
- [`brew doctor` links to Support Tiers](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19657)
- [`brew doctor` checks for OpenCore Legacy Patcher](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/18762)
- [Clarify that the OpenCore Legacy Patcher is Tier 2 or 3](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19751)

#### ARM64 Linux

- [Homebrew provides a Portable Ruby for ARM64 Linux](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19224).
  This is the first step towards hopefully being able to provide Tier 1 support for ARM64 Linux in the future.
- [Homebrew refers to ARM64 Linux, not AArch64 Linux](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19188) (for consistency with macOS)
- [Homebrew publishes some ARM64 Docker images](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19275)

#### Ruby

- [Homebrew provides Portable Ruby 3.4.3](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19779).
  It also requires Ruby >=3.4 to run.
- [Homebrew has enabled Bootsnap by default](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19658). This should make repeated invocations of `brew` much faster.

#### Deprecations

- [Homebrew 4.5's various deprecations/disables/removals](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19801)
- [The Ubuntu 18 Docker image has been removed](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19190)

Other changes since 4.4.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [`brew install --ask` and `HOMEBREW_ASK` allow viewing the packages, dependencies and sizes in a prompt before installation](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19254)
- [`brew install --skip-link` allows installation without running `brew link`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19136)
- [`brew update-if-needed` provides a much faster possible replacement for `brew update` that does nothing if no auto-update is required](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19626)
- [`brew install --as-dependency` allows installation of formulae as dependencies rather than "on request"](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19570)
- [`brew` allows being run by `root` in `podman` containers](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/18574)
- [`HOMEBREW_TEMP` defaults to `/var/tmp` on Linux, assuming it exists, is readable and is writable](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19824)
- [`brew install --cask` produces fewer GitHub Actions warnings](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19009)
- [Homebrew supports GCC 15](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19811)
- [`brew pyenv-sync` creates major version symlinks to fix `pyenv` support](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/18978)
- [The Homebrew macOS `.pkg` installer will upgrade existing installations](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19406)
- [`HOMEBREW_UPGRADE_GREEDY_CASKS` allows specifying a list of casks that should always be upgraded with `--greedy`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19375)
- Formulae can include
  [PowerShell (`pwsh`)](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19407)
  or
  [`clap`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/18945)
  completions.
- [`@@HOMEBREW_PREFIX@@` can be replaced with the value of `HOMEBREW_PREFIX` in external patches](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/18613)
- [`brew alias` and `brew unalias` commands are part of Homebrew/brew rather than an external tap](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19258)
- [`brew edit` and `brew bundle edit` look for VSCode variants, e.g. Cursor](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19545)
- [`brew bump*` can bump synced formulae together](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19798)
- [`brew *env-sync` has a `HOMEBREW_ENV_SYNC_STRICT` mode for stricter version handling](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19577)
- In formulae and casks,
  [`deprecate!`/`disable!` support specifying replacement software](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/18733)
  and
  [can specify replacement type](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19578)
- [`brew bump-*` only warns, rather than errors, on duplicate PRs for non-official taps](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19670)
- [`brew verify` allows verifying package attributions](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19217)
- [`brew audit` flags `pkg-config` dependencies in core tap](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/18843).
  We have fully moved to using `pkgconf` in Homebrew/homebrew-core instead.
- [Formulae allow using Sequoia's `jq` instead of Homebrew's](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/18826)
- [`brew config` prints the current Homebrew/brew branch](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/18811)
- [Homebrew's Tabs/`INSTALL_RECEIPT.json` include the `bottle_rebuild` in `runtime_dependencies`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19576)
- [Homebrew will use macOS's new `lockf` where available](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/18516)
- [Homebrew's CI is no longer running `brew tests` on macOS 13](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19736).
  It was too slow and we're dropping macOS 13 support later this year.

Finally:
