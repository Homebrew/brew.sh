Today I'd like to announce Homebrew 2.6.0. The most significant changes since 2.5.0 are macOS Big Sur support on Intel, `brew` commands replacing all `brew cask` commands, the beginnings of macOS M1/Apple Silicon/ARM support and API deprecations.

Major changes and deprecations since 2.5.0:

- [macOS Big Sur is supported (and High Sierra unsupported)](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/9054)
- [`depends_on :java`, `brew switch`, `brew diy` and various other APIs have been deprecated](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/9209)
- [All `brew cask` commands have been deprecated in favour of `brew` commands (with `--cask`) when necessary](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/8899)
- [`Homebrew.args` is deprecated](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/8795)
- [All `Requirement`s are deprecated in Homebrew/core](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/9052)
- [macOS Homebrew running natively on M1/Apple Silicon/ARM has partial functionality. We recommend installing into `/opt/homebrew` and forbid installing into `/usr/local` (to avoid clashing with the macOS Intel install and allow their usage side-by-side)](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/9117). We currently recommend running Homebrew using Intel emulation with Rosetta 2.
- [`brew tap-new` will set up GitHub Actions workflows to](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/8762) [upload to GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/8410). Read [the blog post](https://brew.sh/2020/11/18/homebrew-tap-with-bottles-uploaded-to-github-releases/) for more documentation.
- [GitHub deprecated their API's basic authentication](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/8826)

Other changes since 2.5.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [`brew doctor` checks the active branch for all taps, not just Homebrew/homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/9305)
- [`brew unbottled` is a new developer command to identify formulae that haven't had binary packages built yet](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/9308)
- [`brew install ./` is now recommended for installing local file formulae](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/9241)
- [Bash, ZSH and Fish formula completion is now much faster with the `brew formulae` command](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/8846)
- [`brew install --force-bottle` refuses to ever build from source](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/9064)
- [`brew install` or `brew link` of a versioned keg-only formula will automatically unlink conflicted version formulae](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/9009)
- [`brew shellenv` is significantly faster](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/8904)
- [Homebrew has further reduced shallow clone usage (on request from GitHub)](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/8883)
- [`brew linkage` and commands using the linkage cache have significantly better performance](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/8695)
- [`brew bump-cask-pr` is a new developer command to create Homebrew/homebrew-cask pull requests](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7986)

Finally:

- [Discourse](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/9144) and [IRC](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/8981) are now deprecated as official communication methods in favour of [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/8802).
- [Homebrew accepts donations through GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Homebrew) and [still accepts donations through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/homebrew). If you can afford it, please consider donating. If you'd rather not use GitHub Sponsors or Patreon (our preferred donation methods), [check out the other ways to donate in our README](https://github.com/homebrew/brew/#donations).

Thanks to all our hard-working maintainers, contributors, sponsors and supporters for getting us this far. Enjoy using Homebrew!
