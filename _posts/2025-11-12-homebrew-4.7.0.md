Today, I'd like to announce Homebrew 4.7.0.
The most significant changes since 4.6.0 are download concurrency by default, official support for Linux ARM64/AARCH64, timescales for deprecating macOS Intel and removing macOS Gatekeeper bypass behaviours.

Major changes and deprecations since 4.6.0:

- [`HOMEBREW_DOWNLOAD_CONCURRENCY=auto` is set by default](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/20975).
  This enables parallel downloads by default for all users.
  It can be disabled by setting `HOMEBREW_DOWNLOAD_CONCURRENCY=1`.
  [Concurrent downloads now have progress reporting](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/20991).
  We expect there may be a long-tail of issues, please report them!
- [Homebrew has promoted Linux ARM64/AARCH64 to Tier 1 support.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/20974)
- [Casks without codesigning have been deprecated](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/20388).
  We will disable all Homebrew/homebrew-cask casks that fail Gatekeeper checks in September 2026.
- Homebrew now provides official macOS 26 (Tahoe) support.
  [Homebrew's future macOS support is noted in our Support Tiers document](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/20497)
  at <https://docs.brew.sh/Support-Tiers#future-macos-support>.
  In September (or later) 2026:
  - Homebrew will not run on macOS Catalina 10.15 and earlier
  - macOS Intel x86_64 will move to Tier 3, dropping CI support and no additional bottles (binary packages) will be built for Intel.
  In September (or later) 2027:
  - Homebrew will not run on macOS Big Sur 11 on Apple Silicon or **at all on Intel x86_64**
- [`HOMEBREW_USE_INTERNAL_API` allows opt-in to the new, smaller internal Homebrew JSON API](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/20951).
  This will become the default behaviour in a later version of Homebrew.
  Please consider opting-in now and reporting any issues you encounter.
- [`--no-quarantine` and `--quarantine` flags have been deprecated as Homebrew does not wish to easily provide circumvention to macOS security features.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/20929)
