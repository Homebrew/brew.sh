Today I'm proud to announce Homebrew 1.0.0. In the seven years since Homebrew was created by [@mxcl](https://github.com/mxcl) our community has grown to [almost 6000 unique contributors](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/graphs/contributors), a [wide-reaching third-party "tap" ecosystem](https://github.com/search?p=2&q=homebrew-&type=Repositories&utf8=✓) and [thousands of packages](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/tree/master/Formula).

We've been working hard over the last year to make some major changes to Homebrew that we've been wanting for a long time. There have been some hiccups along the way but we now have a more stable base for using and developing Homebrew in the future.

These include:

- [Homebrew package management and formulae (package metadata) split into separate repositories](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2)
- [Homebrew Community site (using Discourse) for discussion](http://community.brew.sh)
- [Homebrew joined the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2016/feb/22/homebrew-joins/)
- [Homebrew's default repository installation location changed to `/usr/local/Homebrew` to keep your `/usr/local` cleaner](https://github.com/Homebrew/install/pull/60)
- [Homebrew/brew updates between release tags](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/998)
- [Homebrew CI and homebrew/core use the macOS sandbox for build-time security](https://github.com/Homebrew/legacy-homebrew/pull/38361)
- [Homebrew Cask integrated into Homebrew/brew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/725)
- [Add new `brew bump-formula-pr` command to create new formula version pull requests](https://github.com/Homebrew/legacy-homebrew/pull/49848)
- [Add `brew --help` to `brew` subcommands](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/10)
- [Homebrew auto-updates when needed](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/50)
- [`brew update` sped up by only running `git fetch` if necessary](https://github.com/Homebrew/legacy-homebrew/pull/49219)
- Officially support [`brew bundle`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle) (for `Brewfile`s and import/export) and [`brew services`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-services) (for background services management).
- [Homebrew/brew passes tests on Linux and has generic backend for porting to other platforms in future](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/168)
- [Provide access to developer commands and `brew update` workflow automatically](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/881)
- [Use `curl` for all HTTP access for consistent proxy support](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/295)
- Use [new Ruby Macho library](https://github.com/Homebrew/ruby-macho) for reading and writing library macOS Mach O file locations.
- [Provide vendored, portable Ruby 2 binary for when system Ruby 2 is not available](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/404)
- [`HEAD` package installations have versions and can be upgraded](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/584)
- [Use Python virtualenvs to better handle Python dependencies](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/344)

And finally:

- [Improves formula not found handling](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/96)

Thanks to all our users, contributors and maintainers past and present for getting us to this milestone. Enjoy using Homebrew!
